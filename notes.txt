## Integration notes:
* add HDAGG to the src directory similar to other methods.
* try to have steps separated so we can easily enable/disable it.
* sparse_blas is a temp directory, we will use to facilitate testing.
* all your tests (which is in example directory) will be in sympiler-benchmark
eventually. For now you can keep it here.
* put your profiling demos in the profiler directory. The setup for your
profiler should be in utils.
